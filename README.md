# Codewars Katas

This is the GitHub repository, where I save the solutions of my kata coding challenges from [www.codewars.com](www.codewars.com) and additional unit tests.

## About Codewars

Codewars is a cool online platform that provides coding challenges, often referred to as "kata," to help developers improve their programming skills. It offers a community-driven environment where programmers can solve problems across various programming languages and difficulty levels.

These challenges range from simple to complex, covering a wide range of topics and algorithms. Users can select a challenge, write their code to solve the problem, and submit it for verification. Codewars then evaluates the code and provides feedback on its correctness and efficiency.

## Ranking System

One of the unique aspects of Codewars is its ranking system, which assigns users a "kyu" rank based on their performance. Starting from 8 kyu (the lowest rank), users progress through increasingly difficult challenges, aiming to improve their skills and reach higher ranks.
